# Exploring **geography** and **data sciences**

I created this site to organize my notes and personal GIS & data science projects. This site includes code snippets, various shiny apps, and references to tutorials that I've found valuable.

Thank you Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill for the wonderful **[Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)** library & book, Dan Weru for the clean Hugo theme **"[Compose](https://github.com/onweru/compose)"**, and the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) folks for an awesome IDE.
